										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Active learning is &#8220;a method of learning in which students are actively or experientially involved in the learning process and where there are different levels of active  learning, depending on student involvement.&#8221; (Weltman, p. 8) It is a model of instruction that focuses the responsibility of learning on learners.</p>
<p>It was popularized in the 1990s by its appearance on the Association for the Study of Higher Education (ASHE) report (Bonwell &amp; Eison 1991). In this report they discuss a variety of methodologies for promoting &#8220;active learning&#8221;. They cite literature that indicates that to learn, students must do more than just listen: They must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems. It relates to the three learning domains referred to as knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSA), and that this taxonomy of learning behaviours can be thought of as &#8220;the goals of the learning process&#8221; (Bloom, 1956). In particular, students must engage in such higher-order thinking tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.Active learning engages students in two aspects – doing things and thinking about the things they are doing (Bonwell and Eison, 1991). L. Dee Fink suggests a model for conceptualizing the learning process that might assist teachers in identifying meaningful forms of active learning (dialogue, observing, doing).There are diverse range of alternatives for the term &#8220;active learning&#8221; like learning through play, technology based learning, activity based learning, group work, project method, etc. the underlying factor behind these are some significant qualities and characteristics of active learning.</p>
<p>Active learning is the opposite of passive learning; it is learner-centered, not teacher-centered, and requires more than just listening; active participation of each and every student is a necessary aspect in active learning. Students must be doing things and simultaneously think about the work done and the purpose behind it so that they can enhance their higher order thinking capabilities. Many research studies have proven that active learning as a strategy has promoted achievement levels and some others say that content mastery is possible through active learning strategies. However, some students as well as teachers find it difficult to adapt to the new learning technique.</p>
<p>Active learning should transform students from passive listeners to active participants, helps the student understand the subject through inquiry, gathering and analyzing data to solving higher order cognitive problems. There is intensive use of scientific and quantitative literacy across the curriculum and technology based learning is also in high demand in concern with active learning.[5] Barnes (1989) suggested principles of active learning:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. There is a broad variety of Yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Among the most well-known types of yoga are Hatha yoga and Rāja yoga.</p>
<p>The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions, it is mentioned in the Rigveda but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India&#8217;s ascetic and śramaṇa movements.note The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE,but only gained prominence in the West in the 20th century. Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra.</p>
<p>Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the west, following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a system of physical exercise across the Western world. Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core.One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called Yoga, which has its own epistemology and metaphysics, and is closely related to Hindu Samkhya philosophy.</p>
<p>Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer, schizophrenia, asthma, and heart disease. The results of these studies have been mixed and inconclusive, with cancer studies suggesting none to unclear effectiveness, and others suggesting yoga may reduce risk factors and aid in a patient&#8217;s psychological healing process. On December 1, 2016, Yoga was listed as UNESCO’s Intangible cultural heritage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enhance your child&#8217;s development and love of music through song, dance, movement games and instruments. With an array of styles, our music classes help children explore the power of rhythm, melody, tonality and beat while nurturing key physical, social and intellectual skills.<br />
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the &#8220;color&#8221; of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; &#8220;art of the Muses&#8221;). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as &#8220;the harmony of the spheres&#8221; and &#8220;it is music to my ears&#8221; point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is no noise, only sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>-John Cage</p></blockquote>
