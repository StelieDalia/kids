Infant\/toddler education, a subset of early childhood education, denotes the education of children from birth to age two.[1] It emerged as a field of study during the Enlightenment, particularly in European countries with high literacy rates.[2] It continued to grow through the nineteenth century as universal primary education became a norm in the Western world. In recent years, early childhood education has become a prevalent public policy issue, as municipal, state, and federal lawmakers consider funding for preschool and pre-K.<\/p>\n<h2>Context<\/h2>\n<p>While the first two years of a child&#8217;s life are spent in the creation of a child&#8217;s first &#8220;sense of self&#8221;, most children are able to differentiate between themselves and others by their second year. This differentiation is crucial to the child&#8217;s ability to determine how they should function in relation to other people.[6] Parents can be seen as a child&#8217;s first teacher and therefore an integral part of the early learning process.[7]<\/p>\n<p>Early childhood attachment processes that occurs during early childhood years 0\u20132 years of age, can be influential to future education. With proper guidance and exploration children begin to become more comfortable with their environment, if they have that steady relationship to guide them. Parents who are consistent with response times, and emotions will properly make this attachment early on. If this attachment is not made, there can be detrimental effects on the child in their future relationships and independence. There are proper techniques that parents and caregivers can use to establish these relationships, which will in turn allow children to be more comfortable exploring their environment.[1] Academic Journal Reference This provides experimental research on the emphasis on caregiving effecting attachment. Education for young students can help them excel academically and socially. With exposure and organized lesson plans children can learn anything they want to. The tools they learn to use during these beginning years will provide lifelong benefits to their success. Developmentally, having structure and freedom, children are able to reach their full potential.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning Through Play<\/h2>\n<p>Early childhood education often focuses on learning through play, based on the research and philosophy of Jean Piaget, which posits that play meets the physical, intellectual, language, emotional and social needs (PILES) of children. Children&#8217;s curiosity and imagination naturally evoke learning when unfettered. Learning through play will allow a child to develop cognitively.[8] Thus, children learn more efficiently and gain more knowledge through activities such as dramatic play, art, and social games.[9]<\/p>\n<p>Tassoni suggests that &#8220;some play opportunities will develop specific individual areas of development, but many will develop several areas.&#8221;[10] Thus, It is important that practitioners promote children\u2019s development through play by using various types of play on a daily basis. Allowing children to help get snacks ready helps develop math skills (one-to-one ratio, patterns, etc.), leadership, and communication.[11] Key guidelines for creating a play-based learning environment include providing a safe space, correct supervision, and culturally aware, trained teachers who are knowledgeable about the Early Years Foundation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Early childhood education (ECE; also nursery education) is a branch of education theory which relates to the teaching of young children (formally and informally) up until the age of about eight.
